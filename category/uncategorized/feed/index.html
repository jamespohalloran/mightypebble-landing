				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miner Meltdown&#8217;s transition from Early Access to Full Release is set for Aug 2nd, and there is a pile of new goodies coming with the launch update!<br />
Let&#8217;s get to it!</p>
<h3>New &#8220;Crazy King&#8221; game-type:</h3>
<p><div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video"><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
<video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-639-1" width="640" height="320" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/crazy_king_short-compressed.mp4?_=1" /><a href="https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/crazy_king_short-compressed.mp4">https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/crazy_king_short-compressed.mp4</a></video></div><br />
Enter the king zone to gain points for your team, first team to 150 wins. Oh..except the king zone keeps moving around the map constantly so don&#8217;t get too comfortable.</p>
<h3>New Mutant Type: The Cuddler</h3>
<p><div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-639-2" width="640" height="320" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sucker-drill-compressed.mp4?_=2" /><a href="https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sucker-drill-compressed.mp4">https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/sucker-drill-compressed.mp4</a></video></div><br />
These buggers will jump on your face and jumble up your controls. Luckily you and your teammates can shoot them off before they do too much damage.</p>
<h3>New Destructo-duck weapon:</h3>
<p><div style="width: 640px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-639-3" width="640" height="320" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ducky-compressed.mp4?_=3" /><a href="https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ducky-compressed.mp4">https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/ducky-compressed.mp4</a></video></div><br />
Fly this duck around the mines until you find your target. Careful though! Because your body will be vulnerable while you are controlling the duck.</p>
<h3>Arrow Traps:</h3>
<p><div style="width: 792px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-639-4" width="792" height="412" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/arrow_trap-compressed.mp4?_=4" /><a href="https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/arrow_trap-compressed.mp4">https://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/arrow_trap-compressed.mp4</a></video></div><br />
There&#8217;s another new way to die in the mines: Arrow Traps.</p>
<h3>New Achievements:</h3>
<p>Want more achievements? Well, you&#8217;re in luck because there are 51 new achievements coming with this new update.</p>
<h3>Adjustable Bot Difficulties:</h3>
<p>As the developer of the game, I&#8217;m even having a tough time beating these new &#8220;Hard&#8221; level bots.</p>
<h3>A big ol&#8217; pile of bug fixes:</h3>
<p>Lots of stability improvements coming with this new update. The full patch notes will be coming with the launch update.</p>
<p>Just over 2 weeks until the big update <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="üôÇ" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> :)! See you soon in the mines!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, Miner Meltdown is officially 1 month away from its transition from Early Access to Full Release!<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many have asked me what is the difference of being in Early Access vs Full Release: When Miner Meltdown hit Early Access, it had 1 game-mode, no bots, no unlockable items, and it wasn&#8217;t overly hard to find a fair share of bugs. It was playable, but definitely not a complete game. The game is now very close to being the game that I envisioned making, and this next update will mark a big milestone.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m aligning the game&#8217;s biggest update yet with its full release: New weapons, brand new gametype, and more surprises!<br />
I&#8217;ll share more details on the new features as we get closer to the date!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Miner Meltdown has made huge strides since hitting Early Access in February, and I&#8217;m super thankful to the community for helping shape the direction of the game. </p>
<p>Stay tuned!<br />
&#8211; James</p>
<p>And P.S, If you haven&#8217;t already picked up the game, it&#8217;s still 40% for the Steam Summer Sale!<br />
