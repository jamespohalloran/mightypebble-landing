We have quite the task ahead to crack the top 100 of Steam Greenlight so I very much appreciate everyone&#8217;s vote. And if we get there, I&#8217;m going to be doing this dance move for atleast a few days <a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MinerDanceAnim.gif"><img src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MinerDanceAnim.gif" alt="MinerDanceAnim" width="120" height="120" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-237" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey!</p>
<p>In June, I started messing around with a video game idea that has been floating around in my head for a few years. A few months later, I&#8217;m fortunate enough to be able to turn this into a full-time business endeavour. The last few months have been crazy busy getting this adventure off the ground, but I can&#8217;t wait to share with you all what I&#8217;ve been working on. I&#8217;m going to be announcing my first game next week, followed by a trailer in the coming months, so stay tuned!</p>
<div style="padding-top:20px;"></div>
<p>Also, I think my close friends and family are going to start hating me pretty soon for talking about this game non-stop, so hopefully this blog will allow me to annoy some new people throughout the day! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
