				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey All!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a great couple months! The most recent updates were:</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Cool new sword swooshing!:</h3>
<p>Now it looks much less dumb, and you can also double swoosh<br />
Before:<br />
<a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WonkySword-compressed.gif"><img src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/WonkySword-compressed.gif" alt="old sword miner meltdown" width="480" height="270" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-437" /></a></p>
<p>After:<br />
<a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/swordDoubleSwipe-compressed.gif"><img src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/swordDoubleSwipe-compressed.gif" alt="miner meltdown sword" width="480" height="282" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-438" /></a></p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Beta Testing!</h3>
<p>I had another local beta test with the fine folks down at Thinking Big. Things went leaps and bounds better than the last play-test, and now I have a new list of polish items to fix up for the next test.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Net Code!</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s not as sexy as a cool new sword swoosh&#8230;but it matters and it&#8217;s way better now <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;">A bunch of other cool stuff!</h3>
<p>It was a busy few months! I also implemented text chat (with chat commands), a completely REVOLUTIONARY new way to combat trolls (more details on this coming up soon), and a revamped lobby<br />
&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<h2>&#8220;Cool! so what&#8217;s next?&#8221;</h2>
<p>So, the Early Access release is inching ever so closer! It&#8217;s going to be a pretty nuts 3ish months getting things ready but who really needs sleep? The major things remaining before you can get your hands on the game are:</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Streamlined match finding / joining</h3>
<p>As of right now, you can coordinate with your friends and jump in a game together, but there is currently no way to join a game in progress. This makes it difficult for two random individuals to concurrently find each other&#8217;s games. Addressing this will be priority #1. I also need to add a few tweaks to the lobby browser so that you can find the game with the best connection.</p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Sound Design</h3>
<p>This is a fun one! The lovely and talented Bob Baffy has been working on the soundtrack / SFX for the game and so far it is sounding amazing. You can preview Bob&#8217;s first audio track for the game in the Early Access trailer.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmEgVMecsJg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Controller Support</h3>
<p>This has been a frequently asked for addition. I started it this weekend, and I can already say that it&#8217;s definitely going to be my preferred method of play. </p>
<h3 style="margin-bottom:0px;">Polish Polish Polish</h3>
<p>This part is never really done. Going to spend a significant time cleaning up little things.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks again for reading! Don&#8217;t forget to <a href="http://minermeltdown.net">subscribe to the newsletter</a>, I&#8217;m going to be coordinating an online play-test quite soon for the eager beavers, so stay tuned for that!</p>

<p>Miner Meltdown has been in development for just over a year now, so I thought it would be a good time to look back at this past year to show the game&#8217;s progression thus far.</p>
<p>The concept of the game has been floating in my head for years, but it wasn&#8217;t until July 2015 that I started any heavy development of it. I started off thinking I would do all of the art myself, and at one point, I thought that this actually looked good <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Old.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-398" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Old.png" alt="miner meltdown concept" width="433" height="402" srcset="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Old.png 433w, http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Old-300x279.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 433px) 100vw, 433px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here was the game&#8217;s first prototype..When I had this silly thing working, I was beyond pleased with myself</p>

<p>Then came the next phase&#8230;slightly upgraded art, basic direct ip networking, and we were ready for Steam Greenlight!</p>

<p>2 weeks later, The game was greenlit! This was one of the coolest moments so far, because it showed me that people other than my mom were interested in what I was building.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A good chunk of the next several months was spent completely overhauling the game&#8217;s net-code. It&#8217;s not sexy to show off..but the game&#8217;s net-code simply wasn&#8217;t built for the game to scale. It has since come a long way! **blah blah nerd talk**</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And finally..in came the game&#8217;s new artwork. I struggled for a while making the game pixel perfect, and tweaking the quality settings.. but I&#8217;m very happy with the new look. I&#8217;m going to be unveiling the new trailer soon..but here&#8217;s a very quick sneak peek at the new visuals <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.4/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-iloveimg-compressed.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-400" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-iloveimg-compressed.gif" alt="ezgif-com-video-to-gif-iloveimg-compressed" width="960" height="540" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still have work to do before the game is in your hands, and you are exploding your friends into steaks, but I&#8217;m super happy how far things have come in a year. I can&#8217;t wait to melt your faces with the upcoming trailer, coming your way soon!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, on Thursday, Miner Meltdown was officially unleashed into the wild during the pre-alpha play-test party that we threw at the new Startup Zone in Charlottetown. This was the first time that the game was played outside of close friends.</p>
<p>SooOoo cool to see people actually playing the game against one another for the first time!! Also, super weird! Feels very vulnerable to put your work out there when you know that it&#8217;s still a work in-progress and there are still known issues. That being said, I&#8217;m super happy with how the night went. We ran into plenty of bugs, but every one had a chance to play several full games and got a sense of what the game is about.</p>
<p>Thanks so much to everybody who came out!! and to my family and friends for having plenty of play-test sessions as I patched up some last minute bugs this week :).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pre-release Testing/Alpha</strong></p>
<p>Having a chance to step back after the event, I&#8217;ve rethought how I&#8217;m going to handle my testing process. I was planning on having one big official public &#8220;alpha&#8221; scheduled for late July.</p>
<p>I think the new way that I&#8217;m going to tackle the pre-release is to setup monthly sprints, ending in play-testing sessions over a few hour window. This will allow me to:</p>
<p>a) be more agile, and get feedback faster.</p>
<p>b) get more users testing the game concurrently in small time windows, (rather than leaving an open alpha running for a week)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Features /  Feedback</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve set up a public Trello board, where I&#8217;ll post my progress, allow people to vote on which features they would like to see, and subscribe to get notified when specific features are in place. After I tick off all of the urgent bugs, and finish each month&#8217;s sprint card, I&#8217;ll schedule a play-testing window.</p>
<p>You can check out the board <a href="https://trello.com/b/5Cigo0EX" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>The main items that I&#8217;m going to fix before the next play-testing session are currently:</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-02-at-9.42.23-PM.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-389" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-02-at-9.42.23-PM.png" alt="Miner Meltdown Sprint 1" width="280" height="669" srcset="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-02-at-9.42.23-PM.png 280w, http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-02-at-9.42.23-PM-126x300.png 126w" sizes="(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8230;(plus any of the &#8220;Urgent&#8221; marked items in the bugs list.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to be a part of the next play-test, be sure to subscribe to the email list at <a href="http://minermeltdown.net" target="_blank">minermeltdown.net</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading! And thanks x10000 to everyone who came out the other night and to the lovely Startup Zone folks for hosting! I&#8217;m super lucky to have so much support.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a fun month! The main things on the docket were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Art implementation.</li>
<li>Some small new features.</li>
<li>Alpha prep.</li>
</ul>
<p>First off, here&#8217;s some of the new UI. The score bar&#8217;s been updated, new shop, new backpack (that part&#8217;s my favourite), new side menu for your equipped items, and new health display.</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shopNewGUI-comp.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-372" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/shopNewGUI-comp.gif" alt="shopNewGUI-comp" width="640" height="353" /></a></p>
<p>I added blood!</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/KillThenDie-comp.gif"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-371" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/KillThenDie-comp.gif" alt="KillThenDie-comp" width="640" height="351" /></a></p>
<p>Mutant upgrades!: I added the exploding mutant into the game and added a clawing animation to the melee mutant, so he now does more than just bump into you.</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MeleeMutant-comp.gif"><img class="alemignnone size-full wp-image-370" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MeleeMutant-comp.gif" alt="MeleeMutant-comp" width="640" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re still looking on track for the game&#8217;s alpha next month. Still need to fix a big pile of bugs, add in some hooks so I can do some tracking, and sort out some unknowns around properly distributing the alpha builds (hoping to be able to do so through Steam).</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>And!! If you haven&#8217;t already signed up: you can do so at <a style="font-size: 1.5em;" href="http://minermeltdown.net" target="_blank">minermeltdown.net</a> . </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>And if you could spread the word, then that&#8217;d be just swell!</strong></p>
<p>And for those of you PEI followers, I have booked the startup zone for June 17 for a group play-test session. I&#8217;ll be sending out some details on that this week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for reading!!</p>
<p>James</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the last month, the game is starting to look much different visually, and I&#8217;m quite happy with how it&#8217;s coming along!</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>
<h3>Main Character Design</h3>
<p>A major feature that the audience has been asking for was arms (not really, but we made them anyways!)</p>
<p>Before &amp; After:</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/miner2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-321"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-321" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/miner2.png" alt="Old Miner" width="100" height="100" /></a><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Miner_walk.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-322"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-322" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Miner_walk.gif" alt="Miner_walk" width="128" height="128" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mutants!</h3>
<p>In the initial trailer, the game featured one mutant, and he looked like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MutantAnim.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-236"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-236" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/MutantAnim.gif" alt="MutantAnim" width="120" height="120" /></a></p>
<p>Now we have a bunch! and they look like this!</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mutant_idle.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-317"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-317" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mutant_idle.gif" alt="Mutant_idle" width="128" height="128" /></a><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MutantFullExplode.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-307"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-307" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/MutantFullExplode.gif" alt="MutantFullExplode" width="128" height="128" /></a><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Facehugger_squeeze.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-315"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-315" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Facehugger_squeeze.gif" alt="Facehugger_squeeze" width="128" height="128" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Backgrounds</h3>
<p>During the game&#8217;s state during the greenlight campaign, the backgrounds were very dark. The only piece of the background you could see was the section directly in front of your flashlight.</p>
<p>Before:</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-11.35.10-AM.png" rel="attachment wp-att-320"><img class="alignnone wp-image-320" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-11.35.10-AM.png" alt="OldArt" width="639" height="348" srcset="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-11.35.10-AM.png 1788w, http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-11.35.10-AM-300x164.png 300w, http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-11.35.10-AM-768x419.png 768w, http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-11.35.10-AM-1024x558.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /></a></p>
<p>Now, the background are layered, and the back layer is always illuminated.</p>
<p>After:</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NewBGFast.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-331"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-331" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/NewBGFast.gif" alt="NewBGAnim" width="640" height="424" /></a></p>
<h3>Character skins!</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to give too many of these away right now, but now the game features a giant pile of character skins. Some of them make sense, and some of them are a miner with a butt as a face (actually..only one of them)</p>
<p><a href="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Skins.png" rel="attachment wp-att-323"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-323" src="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Skins.png" alt="Skins" width="344" height="126" srcset="http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Skins.png 344w, http://mightypebble.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Skins-300x110.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>So what&#8217;s next?</h3>
<p>The next major art updates involves replacing the foreground, UI, and weapon art.</p>
<p>Looking forward to showing off the complete overhaul and have some of you playing the game! Be sure to fill out the email form on the site to stay up to date with Miner Meltdown&#8217;s upcoming alpha</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a short little update today to let you all know that this are moving along. I&#8217;m really happy with the progress made these last couple weeks. I initially wasn&#8217;t sure if I was going to include bots in the game, due to the complexities of having so many different gadgets and weapons (which can all behave vastly different), as well as having bots intelligently navigating through an ever-changing destructible level. BUT, I&#8217;m pretty happy with how the AI v1.0 is working so far.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This week I&#8217;m taking a sanity break from AI to work on integration with the Steam API, as well as setting up matchmaking, and handling all that fun network&#8217;ey goodness.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I&#8217;ve had several requests from Youtubers &#038; streamers to allow them to play &#038; stream some pre-release gameplay, which is awesome!. If you&#8217;re interested in such a thing, drop me a line in the Contact form and I&#8217;ll reach out when things are a little further along.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for reading!. This update wasn&#8217;t quite so sexy, so I&#8217;ll end with a cute turtle trying to eat an apple.<br />
